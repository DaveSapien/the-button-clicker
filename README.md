# the-button-clicker
A chrome extension that auto presses the reddit 'the button'.
Something I wrote on a whim, it's stupid. Hopfully the js is educational for someone one day.
<p>
To test this distro: 
<br>
1. unzip <br>
2. open chrome <br>
3. open the URL, chrome://extensions/ <br>
4. click the 'Load unpacked extension...' button <br>
5. select the 'the-button-clicker' folder <br>
6. navagate to www.reddit.com/r/thebutton <br>
7. enjoy the pointlesness of it all <br>
<p>
Alternativly you can install from this Chrome extention store link:<br>

<br>
Then navagate to www.reddit.com/r/thebutton
