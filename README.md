# the-button-clicker
A chrome extension that auto presses the reddit 'the button'.
Something I wrote on a whim, it's stupid. Hopfully the js is educational for someone one day.

To test this distro:
1. unzip
2. open chrome
3. open the URL, chrome://extensions/
4. click the 'Load unpacked extension...' button
5. select the 'the-button-clicker' folder
6. navagate to www.reddit.com/r/thebutton
7. enjoy the pointlesness of it all.

Alternativly you can install from this Chrome extention store link:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-button-clicker/akiejgjmkokikipnghfklokijfhceidk
Then navagate to www.reddit.com/r/thebutton
